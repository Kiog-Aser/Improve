## The Goal.

Before I introduce you to the platform, let's talk about the goal. My goal is clear, bring 100% free education that is 5-10 times better than schools and keep it open-source and community driven. 
In normal words, create a platform where we educate each other as a community.


## 2 main sections

The moment you enter the platform, you will see some recent posts, a side bar and a some widgets. Let's start by talking about the side bar. In this side bar you will find 2 main sections: Valuable Content and Forum Wisdom.
Let's take a closer look at both.

### Valuable Content

This sections is a place where everyone can share some good content they recently made/found. This could be a good book, a great blog post or a valuable YouTube video. 

### Forum Wisdom

This is a place where you can share you own life-lessons and experiences. This is where you will find more real conversations and where you can ask questions to other members.
